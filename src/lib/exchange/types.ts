   * Spot Trading (Default - Recommended for Beginners)
   *
   * **What it is:** Regular trading where you buy and sell actual cryptocurrencies
   * using only the money you have in your account. No borrowing, no leverage.
   *
   * **How it works:**
   * - You buy BTC with your USDT → You own actual BTC
   * - You sell BTC → You get actual USDT
   * - You can only trade with money you actually have
   *
   * **Key Features:**
   * - ✅ Safest trading mode (no liquidation risk)
   * - ✅ You own the actual coins
   * - ✅ Can withdraw coins to your wallet
   * - ✅ No interest fees
   * - ❌ Cannot short (bet against price going down)
   * - ❌ Cannot use leverage (amplify gains/losses)
   *
   * **Best for:**
   * - Beginners learning to trade
   * - Long-term investors
   * - People who want to actually own cryptocurrencies
   * - Low-risk trading strategies
   *
   * **Example:**
   * ```typescript
   * // You have $1000 USDT, buy 0.02 BTC at $50,000
   * // You now own 0.02 BTC, have $0 USDT
   * // If BTC goes to $60,000, you can sell for $1,200 (20% profit)
   * // If BTC goes to $40,000, you can sell for $800 (20% loss)
   * // Maximum loss: Your initial $1000 (if BTC goes to $0)
   * ```
   *
   * **Risk Level:** ⭐ Low (1/5)

  /**
   * Cross Margin Trading (Advanced - Use with Caution)
   *
   * **What it is:** Trading with borrowed money (margin) where all your assets
   * in the margin account can be used as collateral. If one position fails,
   * other positions can be liquidated to cover losses.
   *
   * **How it works:**
   * - You deposit $1000 USDT as collateral
   * - Exchange lends you $2000 more (2x leverage)
   * - You can now trade with $3000 total
   * - All your margin account assets are at risk if any position fails
   *
   * **Key Features:**
   * - ✅ Can use leverage (borrow money to trade more)
   * - ✅ Can short (bet against price going down)
   * - ✅ More flexible than isolated margin
   * - ❌ High risk - can lose more than you deposit
   * - ❌ All positions share the same collateral pool
   * - ❌ One bad trade can liquidate all your positions
   * - ❌ Interest fees on borrowed funds
   *
   * **Best for:**
   * - Experienced traders
   * - Diversified portfolios where you want shared collateral
   * - Traders comfortable with high risk
   *
   * **Example:**
   * ```typescript
   * // You deposit $1000 USDT, get 2x leverage = $2000 to trade
   * // Buy 0.04 BTC at $50,000 (using $2000)
   * // If BTC goes to $60,000: You make $800 (80% profit on $1000)
   * // If BTC goes to $40,000: You lose $800 (80% loss on $1000)
   * // If BTC goes to $37,500: You get liquidated (lose everything)
   * ```
   *
   * **Risk Level:** ⭐⭐⭐⭐ High (4/5)
   *
   * **⚠️ Warning:** Only use if you understand liquidation risks and can afford to lose your entire margin account.

  /**
   * Isolated Margin Trading (Advanced - Use with Caution)
   *
   * **What it is:** Trading with borrowed money (margin) where each position
   * has its own isolated collateral. If one position fails, only that position's
   * collateral is lost - other positions are protected.
   *
   * **How it works:**
   * - You deposit $1000 USDT as collateral for Position A
   * - Exchange lends you $2000 more (2x leverage) for Position A
   * - You can have Position B with separate $500 collateral
   * - If Position A fails, Position B is safe
   *
   * **Key Features:**
   * - ✅ Can use leverage (borrow money to trade more)
   * - ✅ Can short (bet against price going down)
   * - ✅ Each position is isolated - safer than cross margin
   * - ✅ Can limit losses to specific positions
   * - ❌ High risk - can lose more than you deposit per position
   * - ❌ Interest fees on borrowed funds
   * - ❌ Less capital efficient than cross margin
   *
   * **Best for:**
   * - Experienced traders who want position isolation
   * - Risk management (limiting exposure per trade)
   * - Testing strategies without risking entire account
   *
   * **Example:**
   * ```typescript
   * // Position A: Deposit $1000, get 2x leverage = $2000 to trade BTC
   * // Position B: Deposit $500, get 3x leverage = $1500 to trade ETH
   * // If BTC trade fails and gets liquidated, you lose $1000
   * // But your ETH position with $500 is still safe
   * ```
   *
   * **Risk Level:** ⭐⭐⭐⭐ High (4/5)
   *
   * **⚠️ Warning:** Safer than cross margin, but still high risk. Only use if you understand liquidation risks.

  MARGIN_ISOLATED = "margin_isolated",

  /**
   * Futures Trading (Advanced - Highest Risk)
   *
   * **What it is:** Trading contracts that represent future prices of cryptocurrencies.
   * You don't own the actual coins - you're trading price movements. Supports very
   * high leverage (often 10x, 25x, 50x, or even 100x).
   *
   * **⏰ TIME WINDOW / EXPIRATION:**
   * **YES! Futures contracts have expiration dates.** This is a critical difference from spot trading.
   *
   * **Types of Futures Contracts:**
   *
   * 1. **Perpetual Futures (Most Common)**
   *    - No expiration date - can hold indefinitely
   *    - BUT: You pay funding fees every 8 hours (usually)
   *    - Funding fees keep the contract price close to spot price
   *    - Most popular type on crypto exchanges
   *    - Example: BTC-USDT-PERP (perpetual)
   *
   * 2. **Quarterly/Delivery Futures**
   *    - Have specific expiration dates (e.g., end of quarter)
   *    - Must close or roll over before expiration
   *    - At expiration: Settled at spot price or physical delivery
   *    - Example: BTC-USDT-240329 (expires March 29, 2024)
   *
   * 3. **Weekly/Monthly Futures**
   *    - Shorter expiration periods (weekly or monthly)
   *    - More frequent rollover needed
   *    - Example: BTC-USDT-240315 (expires March 15, 2024)
   *
   * **What Happens at Expiration?**
   * - **Perpetual:** Nothing - they never expire, but you pay funding fees
   * - **Delivery Futures:** Contract settles at the spot price at expiration time
   * - **Physical Delivery:** You receive actual coins (rare in crypto)
   * - **Cash Settlement:** Profit/loss is calculated and added/subtracted from your balance
   *
   * **How it works:**
   * - You buy a futures contract for BTC at $50,000
   * - If BTC goes to $60,000, you profit $10,000 per contract
   * - If BTC goes to $40,000, you lose $10,000 per contract
   * - You can use very high leverage (10x, 25x, 50x, 100x)
   * - Contracts expire or are settled periodically (unless perpetual)
   * - Perpetual contracts charge funding fees every 8 hours
   *
   * **Key Features:**
   * - ✅ Can use very high leverage (10x to 100x)
   * - ✅ Can short easily (bet against price)
   * - ✅ No need to own actual cryptocurrencies
   * - ✅ Can trade with smaller capital
   * - ✅ Perpetual futures don't expire (but have funding fees)
   * - ❌ Extremely high risk - can lose everything quickly
   * - ❌ Very easy to get liquidated
   * - ❌ Funding fees (periodic payments on perpetual contracts)
   * - ❌ Expiration dates on delivery futures (must manage)
   * - ❌ Don't own actual coins (unless physical delivery)
   * - ❌ Complex settlement mechanisms
   *
   * **Best for:**
   * - Professional traders
   * - Speculators comfortable with extreme risk
   * - Hedging strategies
   * - Day traders with experience
   * - Traders who can monitor positions regularly
   *
   * **Example - Perpetual Futures:**
   * ```typescript
   * // You deposit $1000, use 10x leverage = $10,000 position
   * // Buy 1 BTC perpetual futures contract at $50,000
   * // If BTC goes to $51,000: You make $1,000 (100% profit on $1000)
   * // If BTC goes to $49,000: You lose $1,000 (100% loss on $1000)
   * // Every 8 hours: You pay funding fee (usually 0.01-0.1% of position)
   * // No expiration: Can hold as long as you want (but keep paying fees)
   * ```
   *
   * **Example - Quarterly Futures:**
   * ```typescript
   * // You buy BTC quarterly futures expiring March 29, 2024
   * // Contract price: $50,000
   * // On March 29, 2024 at 8:00 AM UTC: Contract expires
   * // Settlement: If BTC spot price is $55,000, you profit $5,000 per contract
   * // You must close or roll over before expiration, or it auto-settles
   * ```
   *
   * **Risk Level:** ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ Extreme (5/5)
   *
   * **⚠️ Warning:** Extremely risky. Most beginners lose money. Only use if you:
   * - Fully understand futures contracts and expiration mechanics
   * - Understand liquidation mechanics
   * - Can afford to lose 100% of your capital
   * - Have experience with lower-risk trading modes
   * - Have a solid risk management strategy
   * - Can monitor positions regularly (especially for delivery futures)
   * - Understand funding fees (for perpetual contracts)
   *
   * **💡 Pro Tip:** Most crypto exchanges use perpetual futures by default.
   * Always check if your contract is perpetual or has an expiration date!
